# BehavioralAuthentication

We  present  an  approach  to  a  mostly  unsuperviseduser authentication and identification based on mouse dynamics.Our  hypothesis  is  that  one  can  successfully  identify  a  user  onthe  basis  of  cursor  movements.  Our  system  identifies  a  user  asunauthorized if the behavior within a 10 seconds period deviatessufficiently  from  the  learned  behavior  of  an  authorized  user.Our  results  for  four  users  show  that  we  can  identify  these  asunauthorized based on their cursor dynamics with a false positiverate  of  0%  and  a  false  negative  rate  of  20%  on  the  authorizeduser data. Nevertheless, we have to research more thoroughly anduse more data to validate our results. We point out that analysingcursor  dynamics  alone  is  not  yet  sufficient  for  a  practical  userauthentication system.
